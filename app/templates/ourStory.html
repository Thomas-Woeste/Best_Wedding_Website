              <div id="p1">JJ and Haley first met each other when JJ moved to Winchester, KY in 2012. A friendship formed when he found himself needing help in Conkwright’s magnet program. Haley was the best student – bright, funny, and beautiful. However, like most middle school age boys, immaturity prevailed, causing Joshua to not realize the potential of a lifelong relationship. <br><br></div>
              
              <div id="p1">Moving to Clark Middle School in 8th grade, Joshua and Haley’s friendship had a short hiatus. Fast forward three years later, they had class together once more: Mrs. Cope’s English Class. The friendship grew to the point that the pair “fake dated”. To this day, they still do not know what that meant. Regardless, they were still unaware of the feelings they had towards to each other. <br><br></div>
              
              <div id="p1">While sitting in the gymnasium at George Roger Clark High School.  Mrs. Cope called Haley aside and suggested that she and JJ would make the cutest couple.” A thought that never entered their minds before, the friendship grew into “best friend” status. Throughout the summer, Haley and JJ began spending more time together. Once junior year of high school rolled around JJ had a great idea of how to get even closer to Haley – asking her to take him to and from school every day. The only obstacle standing in his way was her parents. <br><br></div>
              
              <div id="p1">One day, JJ happened to run into Haley and her parents at the Winchester Kroger. An unplanned introduction to his future in-laws resulted in permission for Haley to drive JJ across town for the remainder of the year. Several months passed, and JJ gained the courage to ask Haley to the Junior Homecoming dance. In normal JJ fashion, he told Haley that she was going to be his girlfriend, and reluctantly she accepted. <br><br></div>
              
              <div id="p1">This was the beginning of a relationship but not the end. With love, Haley and JJ are excited to celebrate their wedding with you on June the 4th. God Bless! <br><br></div>
